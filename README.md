## Challenge routmap

### 1 Details of chalenge
I'm do the Challenge especific to:
- Mobile: 375px
- Desktop: 1440px
devices.

If you try in others widths, the page can fail.

### 2 Bugs
You cant try input mail again if you put once. You need reload the page
(click in logo)

Maybe i fix the bug in future, but i need advance in other projects.

### 3 Sizes
The size is do with a literal plastic external rule. I'm try practice VW and VH, and its destroy my life.
If you start a proyect, and if you know the app going to be responsive, use VH and VW only in body, or especific elements. Don't be dump like me.

Font size basic is in 16px
